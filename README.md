To edit the application I have used Prepros which is a tool that compiles your files, transpiles your JavaScript, reloads your browsers and makes it really easy to develop & test your websites so you can focus on making them perfect. [‚û°Ô∏è Prepros ](https://prepros.io/)

You can use `servor` to start a simple server.

_Run server:_

    npm run start

_Output:_
